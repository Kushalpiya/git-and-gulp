        <h2>I like to go swimming in the summer.</h2>
        <p>
            Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer. When the sun is shining <br> and the air is warm, you will find me dipping into my backyard pool. It's not an <br> impressive pool, only three feet deep, but it's mine. <br>There are
            three reasons I like to swim:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I get lots of exercise.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the freedom.</li>
            <li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun.</li>
        </ul>
